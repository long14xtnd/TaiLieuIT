A search engineâ€™s ability to retrieve desirable datasets is important for data sharing and reuse. Existing dataset search engines typically rely on matching queries to dataset descriptions. However, a user may not have enough prior knowledge to write a query using terms that match with description text. We propose a novel schema label generation model which generates possible schema labels based on dataset
table content. We incorporate the generated schema labels into a mixed ranking model which not only considers the relevance between the query and dataset metadata but also the similarity between the query and gen-
erated schema labels. To evaluate our method on real-world datasets, we create a new benchmark specifically for the dataset retrieval task. Exper-
iments show that our approach can effectively improve the precision and NDCG scores of the dataset retrieval task compared with baseline meth-
ods. We also test on a collection of Wikipedia tables to show that the features generated from schema labels can improve the unsupervised and
supervised web table retrieval task as well.
